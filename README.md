# PokemonCli

Welcome! Thank you for checking out my cli! After all the appropriate gems listed on line 22 (README.md)  are installed and ./bin/executable is entered into the terminal my pokemon CLI will ask you if you would like to view your pokedex.  My CLI then lists all of the pokemon names. Once chosen it then shows the stats.  So basically you are able to choose the pokemon and the specific data you would like. I hope you like using my Pokemon CLI. ENJOY!! See the legend starting on line 5(README.md) for more details on Pokemon stats.

STAT LEGEND: moves(list of Pokemon moves, moves are used during a turned based battle)
             types(list of Pokemon types, a Pokemon can have more than one type, ex. fire,flying)
             abilities( Abilities were introduced in Generation III as an all new game mechanic. Each and every Pokémon has an ability, and can only have one at a time)
